# **Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra**

This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree Program.

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

### Objectives: Create queries to ask the following three questions of the data

#### 1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4

#### 2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
    
#### 3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'

# **Datasets**

For this project, you'll be working with one dataset:Â `event_data`. The directory of CSV files partitioned by date. Here are examples of filepaths to two files in the dataset:

```
event_data/2018-11-08-events.csv
event_data/2018-11-09-events.csv
```

# **Notebook**
The notebook Project_1B_ Project_Template is divided by:

- Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files: manipulating all the csv files and
exporting to a single csv.
- Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project: Creating tables
and doing queries.
